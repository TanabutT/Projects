    "<li><a href=\"https://keras.io/layers/core/#dropout\"><code>Dropout</code></a>. This prevents the model from overfitting, i.e. perfectly remembering each image, by randomly setting 25% of the input units to 0 at each update during training.</li>\n",
    "<li><a href=\"https://keras.io/layers/core/#flatten\"><code>Flatten</code></a>. As its name suggests, this flattens the output from the convolutional part of the CNN into a one-dimensional feature vector which can be passed into the following fully connected layers.</li>\n",
    "<li><a href=\"https://keras.io/layers/core/#dense\"><code>Dense</code></a>. Fully connected layer where every input is connected to every output (see image below).</li>\n",
    "<li><a href=\"https://keras.io/layers/core/#dropout\"><code>Dropout</code></a>. Another dropout layer to safeguard against overfitting, this time with a rate of 50%.</li>\n",
